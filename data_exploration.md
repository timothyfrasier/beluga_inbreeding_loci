## VCF Files
The VCF file format (variant call format) is one of the many file types that you can use with genomic data. This file is generally quite a bit smaller than other file types because it *only contains data for the variable sites that have been called within a data set*. There is one row per site, and the data for each individual/sample is in a different column. A diagram giving a general picture for a VCF file is shown below (from Van der Auwera & O'Connor 2020).
