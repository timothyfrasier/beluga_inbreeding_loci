## Styling text

This is **bold**. This is *italics*. This is <ins>underlined</ins>. 

Below is a line of code - a very useful one. 
```
ls
```

***This is bold and italics, so obviously super important***. 

If I wanted to show a square meter I could use a superscript like this: m<sup>2</sup>.

For carbon dioxide, I could instead use subscript notation like this: CO<sub>2</sub>.
